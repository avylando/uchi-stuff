Usage (e.g. `sync-branch.sh`):

Set rights to execute:

`chmod ugo+rwx sync-branch.sh`

Copy in some directory presented in $PATH to make accessible in terminal from any directory:

`sudo cp sync-branch.sh /usr/local/bin/sync-branch`

**Warning!** This will overwrite `sync-branch.sh` in `/usr/local/bin/`, if presented.

After these step you can use `sync-branch` command from any directory.
